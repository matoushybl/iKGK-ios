# iKGK-ios
iOS version of my app simplifying access to school websites

#Used libraries
* AFNetworking
* Realm
* SnapKit
* Classy
* SwiftyJson
* SwiftMoment
* SwiftKit - an awesome library, check it out on (http://github.com/Brightify/SwiftKit)[]

#TODO
* Update versions of libraries
* Use RealmSwift instead of Realm
* Test it
* Go through TODOs and FIXMEs
* Publish it - pay 100 USD annually :)
* Update API links
* Improve design
* Refactor code - it is really bad

**Feel free to contact me. I'll certainly try to help.**
